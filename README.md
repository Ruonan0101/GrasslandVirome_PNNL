Viral communities detected from three grasslands with a historical precipitation gradient (IA > KS > WA)

This repo contains 
1) R codes used for ploting the figures of manuscript titled 'DNA viral diversity, abundance and functional potential vary across grassland soils with a range of historical moisture regimes' (currently submitted for review)
2) R code of structure equation modeling used in the manuscript
3) lysozyme hidden markov models
4) viral contigs screened from the de novo assemblies of the metaegnomes
